      "Remarks: Both documents provided have issues. The residence permit is invalid due to expiration, and the enrollment letter appears to be from a different registration. Furthermore, the enrollment letter cannot replace a residence permit. This suggests that the applicant may not have a valid residence permit and the provided documents may not be sufficient for their current application.\n",

These omissions render the document partially invalid.\n",
